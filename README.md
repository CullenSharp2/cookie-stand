# LAB 06 - Demo

----

## Salmon Cookies

This is a webpage I made for Lab 2 of code 201. It prompts you for some input, and says your name. It says my name too, and a little about me. All of this was made simply with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I added a 'top ten' songs section to the end of my page, and a number of guessing games (seven of them). The page tracks your score displaying it at the end. 

Roman and Skyler assisted during pair programming.

### Reflections and Comments

- I think appjs could look a little less goofy. There's refactoring to be done there.

- Couldn't figure out how to get my paragraph to wrap around, and get the box to fit snug around that.
